Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. I will be building a new set of tools that will visualize their earthquake data live. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, and so this project should be helpful.
